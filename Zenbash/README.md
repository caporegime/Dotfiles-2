Dzen2 Bar Setup.

I tried making it Flexible as possible.
Made it easier to configure.
Didn't try to add too much.

Mod to your liking!

Notes
==

- Setup
    - Split the Bars down the middle. Is Easy to Setup.
    - First find your **Resolution Width**, Example mine is 1920. Divide it by two, Equals 960.
    - Edit **WB** in **Settings** File to yours.
    - Edit Weather Zipcode in **Right**.
    - If you want Celcius, See **Weather** script.

Everything should be included! Make sure to Check everything!! Twice!!!

* Icons are fixed Height of 24px.

Thanks to Buttons, For the Weather Script

Thanks to Trilby, For helping with the Weather loops!
